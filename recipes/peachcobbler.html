    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cobbler — not to be confused with a crisp or crumble — is a deep-dish fruit dessert with a sweetened fruit filling that is topped off with a biscuit-like dough. The dough may cover the entire dish or be dropped by the spoonful, earning it the name "cobbler" for its resemblance to a cobblestone street. It gives you the same fruit-and-pastry combination as pie, but without all the effort. This old-fashioned peach cobbler recipe uses fresh peaches and a buttery cobbler topping that's made form scratch. It's a delicious summer dessert we've perfected over the years!</p>
    <p>A warm mixture of sweetened, juicy peaches is topped with a biscuit-like dough and sprinkled in cinnamon sugar. Although it's made from scratch with fresh peaches, this easy peach cobbler is incredibly simple and comes together in just one hour.</p>
